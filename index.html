                    People with special dietary restrictions may become frustrated or confused by the
                    lack of visibility for food items that comply with these restrictions. Not being able to
                    easily know if a restaurant accommodates their needs can make picking a place to eat a
                    difficult task. Our solution would provide users with a resource to more easily find
                    restaurants and food items that fit their dietary needs

                    based on their dietary needs.
